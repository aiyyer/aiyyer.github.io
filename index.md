.  We are currently working on research problems related to:

- [Atmospheric Waves](Research/index.html#easterly-waves)
- [Hurricane formation and variability](Research/index.html#kelvin-waves)
- [Stormtrack dynamics](Research/index.html)
- [Agricultural Meteorology and Remote Sensing](Research/index.html)
