Welcome to Large Scale Atmospheric Dynamics at [NCSU](https://www.ncsu.edu/)

----------------
We are in the department of [Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://meas.sciences.ncsu.edu).
Our [group](Group/index.html) is interested in all aspects of modeling and observation of atmospheric phenomena.

We are currently working on research problems related to:

- [Atmospheric Waves](Research/index.html#easterly-waves)
- [Hurricane formation and variability](Research/index.html#kelvin-waves)
- [Stormtrack dynamics](Research/index.html)
- Sensor networks, remote sensing and data analytics
