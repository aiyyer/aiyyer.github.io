Some of the most intense thunderstorms occur during the summer monsoon over tropical North Africa. Often, these severe storms are clustered in large groups called mesocale convective systems (MCS). As we look further up in spatial scales, we find that these MCS themselve tend to be organized in groups that are separated by distances of 1000 km or more. This is illustrated nicely by the satellite image
