A new paper (With James Russell and Dylan White) on easterly waves and moist convection has been  published in the <em>Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems.</em>

|  |In this paper, we examine how clusters of precipitating convection within the envelope of synoptic scale easterly waves over Africa can help  maintain the latter. We use a numerical weather forecasting model that can represent important features of the mesocale convective cloud clusters. We connect the results of our simulations to prior studies of equatorial/tropical wave instabilities. The interaction between the parent wave and the upscale effect of moist convection is viewed from the perspective of potential vorticity (potential vorticity) budget. The key finding is that the production of PV by the diabatic heating associated with large swath of stratiform rainfall reinforces the existing PV within the wave. Since easterly waves exist within the regime of balanced dynamics, there is an implicit connection between PV and the wave's wind and thermal structure. The enhancement of the wave's wind and thermal perturbations can precondition the atmosphere for subsequent moist convection, thus closing the loop for the feedback and instability|
