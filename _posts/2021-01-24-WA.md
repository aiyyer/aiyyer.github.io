A new paper (With Terrell Wade) on acceleration of tropical cyclones and potential connection with poleward shift in the extratropical stormtrack has been submitted to WCD. Comments and reviews are welcome and can be included in the open discussions linked below:

|[Acceleration of Tropical Cyclones As a Proxy For Extratropical Interactions: Synoptic-Scale Patterns and Long-Term Trends](https://wcd.copernicus.org/preprints/wcd-2021-4/)


|**Plain language Summary**| Using a large sample of Atlantic tropical cyclone tracks, we diagnose the mean circulations in the extratropics that are associated with rapid changes in the storm speeds. We show that rapid accelerations and decelerations are associated with distinct phasing between the tropical cyclone and weather waves of the extratropics. We also show that over the past 5 decades, rapid acceleration and deceleration of tropical cyclones have reduced in magnitude. We speculate that these trends may reflect the poleward shift and weakening of extratropical Rossby waves that has been reported in several recent studies.|
